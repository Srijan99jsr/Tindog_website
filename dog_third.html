              <p class="card-text">
                The Mastiff is a large and powerful dog breed known for its
                impressive size, strength, and gentle nature
              </p>
              <p>
                Physical Appearance: Mastiffs are among the largest dog breeds,
                with a massive and muscular build. They have a heavy and broad
                head with a short, square muzzle. Their ears are medium-sized
                and hang down close to the head. The eyes are expressive and
                usually dark in color. Mastiffs have a deep, wide chest and a
                strong, sturdy body. They have a short coat that can come in
                various colors, including fawn, brindle, and apricot. Despite
                their large size, they have a dignified and gentle expression.
              </p>
              <p>
                Temperament: Mastiffs are known for their calm, gentle, and
                patient temperament. They are generally docile and affectionate
                dogs that form strong bonds with their families. Mastiffs are
                known to be excellent with children, often displaying a
                protective and nurturing instinct towards them. They are
                typically friendly towards strangers but can be reserved or
                aloof until properly introduced. Although they have a gentle
                nature, their size and protective instincts make them excellent
                guard dogs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Energy Level and Exercise: Mastiffs have a moderate energy level
                and are generally considered a low-activity breed. While they
                don't require extensive exercise, they do benefit from regular
                walks and moderate activity to keep them physically and mentally
                stimulated. Due to their large size and heavy build, it's
                important to avoid overexertion or excessive exercise when they
                are young and still growing. Mastiffs are also sensitive to hot
                and humid weather, so they should be kept in a cool and
                comfortable environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Intelligence and Trainability: Mastiffs are intelligent dogs
                that are generally eager to please their owners. However, they
                can also be independent and strong-willed at times, requiring
                consistent and patient training methods. Early socialization and
                obedience training are crucial for Mastiffs to ensure they
                develop good manners and appropriate behavior. Positive
                reinforcement techniques, such as rewards and praise, work well
                with this breed. They respond best to gentle and firm guidance
                rather than harsh training methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Health: Mastiffs, like many large dog breeds, are prone to
                certain health issues. Some common health concerns in Mastiffs
                include hip and elbow dysplasia, gastric dilatation-volvulus
                (bloat), heart conditions, and certain types of cancer. Regular
                veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, proper weight management,
                and exercise are important to maintain their overall health and
                well-being. It's also crucial to provide them with a comfortable
                and spacious living environment suitable for their size.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companionship: Mastiffs are known for their loyalty and devotion
                to their families. They thrive on human companionship and are
                often referred to as "gentle giants" due to their calm and
                gentle nature. They are excellent family dogs, known to be
                patient and tolerant with children. Mastiffs can be protective
                of their loved ones and are natural guardians. However, early
                socialization is necessary to ensure they are well-mannered and
                well-adjusted in various social situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, the Mastiff is a gentle, loyal, and powerful dog
                breed. With proper socialization, training, and care, Mastiffs
                can be loving and devoted family companions. Their imposing size
                and protective nature make them excellent guard dogs, while
                their gentle temperament makes them great with children.
