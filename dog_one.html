              <p class="card-text">
                The Chihuahua is a small dog breed known for its tiny size,
                alert expression, and energetic personality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Physical Appearance: Chihuahuas are one of the smallest dog
                breeds, typically weighing between 2 to 6 pounds (0.9 to 2.7
                kilograms) and standing about 5 to 8 inches (13 to 20
                centimeters) tall at the shoulder. They have a compact and
                well-balanced body structure. Their head is apple-shaped or
                slightly rounded, with a short and pointed muzzle. The ears are
                large, erect, and slightly flared at the base, giving them a
                keen and alert expression. The eyes are usually large and round,
                and their coat can be either short or long, with various color
                patterns and combinations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Temperament: Despite their small size, Chihuahuas possess a bold
                and confident temperament. They are generally loyal,
                affectionate, and deeply attached to their owners. Chihuahuas
                are known for their strong bond with a single person and can be
                quite protective. They are often wary of strangers and may
                display territorial behavior, barking or growling to alert their
                owners. Due to their small size, they may exhibit a certain
                level of fear or aggression if they feel threatened. Early
                socialization and training are essential to help them develop
                good behavior and overcome any potential behavior issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Energy Level and Exercise: Chihuahuas have a surprising amount
                of energy for their size. They are active and enjoy playtime,
                walks, and engaging in various activities. However, their
                exercise needs can be met with moderate daily exercise such as
                short walks, interactive play sessions, and mental stimulation.
                Chihuahuas should be protected from extreme temperatures due to
                their small size and relatively thin coat, as they are more
                sensitive to cold weather.
              </p>

              <p>
                Intelligence and Trainability: Chihuahuas are intelligent dogs
                and are generally quick learners. However, they can sometimes be
                stubborn or independent, which may make training a bit
                challenging. Consistent, positive reinforcement training methods
                work best for Chihuahuas. Early socialization and obedience
                training are important to ensure they grow up to be well-behaved
                and adaptable in different environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Health: Chihuahuas, like other small dog breeds, can be prone to
                certain health issues. Some common health concerns include
                dental problems, patellar luxation (knee joint dislocation),
                heart conditions, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and obesity.
                Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, dental care, and
                appropriate exercise can help maintain their overall health and
                well-being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companionship: Chihuahuas make excellent companions and are
                well-suited for various living situations. Due to their small
                size, they can adapt well to apartment living, but they also
                enjoy having a yard to explore. They are generally good with
                older children who understand how to handle small dogs, but they
                may not tolerate rough handling or excessive teasing. Chihuahuas
                can coexist with other pets if introduced properly and given
                time to adjust. In conclusion, the Chihuahua is a small, lively,
                and loyal companion. Despite their tiny size, they possess a big
                personality and require adequate socialization, training, and
                care to thrive and lead a happy, healthy life.
